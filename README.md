Suspicious Activity Recognition

## How to Execute Files

1. **Training Models**: 
    - Separate models need to be trained for object detection and emotion recognition.
  
2. **Model Saving**:
    - Save each trained model separately.

3. **Execution**:
    - Run `mainFile.py` to execute the program.
